\title{Weighted Product with Inverse Normalization}
\usage{
invweight_prod(x, w = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or list of numeric values.}

\item{w}{Optional numeric scalar. Weight applied to each element. If \code{NULL}, it is automatically set to the ratio \code{length(x) / length(na.omit(x))}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the weighted product of non-NA values in \code{x}, capped at 1.
}
\description{
Compute the product of input values with inverse weighting to compensate for missing values.
}
\details{
This function is useful when combining multiple probabilities with missing entries.
It corrects the product by inflating it with an inverse of the missing rate.
