\title{Add combined significance probability P0}
\usage{
add_P0(proc)
}
\arguments{
\item{proc}{A dataframe with `Ppois`, `Pexp`, and `anomaly` columns.}
}
\value{
The input dataframe with an added `P0` column.
}
\description{
Computes the joint significance probability \eqn{\mathbb{P}_0 = P_{\text{Pois}} \cdot P_{\text{Exp}}}
for each anomalous cluster. This is only computed for rows with `anomaly == 1`.
}
\details{
After computation, the rowwise structure is removed to avoid unintended behavior in subsequent operations.
