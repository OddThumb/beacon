\title{Reproduce the `proc` and coincidence result for a specific batch}
\usage{
reproduce(
  batch_set,
  batch_at = NULL,
  batch_num = NULL,
  result,
  window_size = NULL,
  overlap = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch_set}{A list of batch Rist objects per detector (output of `batching_network()`).}

\item{batch_at}{Optional numeric. GPS time (in seconds) indicating the batch to be reproduced.}

\item{batch_num}{Optional integer. Index of the batch to be reproduced.}

\item{result}{A list returned by \code{stream()}, containing \code{res.net}, \code{arch_params}, and other pipeline results.}

\item{window_size}{Optional numeric. Coincidence window size (in seconds). If \code{NULL}, taken from \code{result$arch_params}.}

\item{overlap}{Optional numeric. Overlap size (in seconds) for coincidence binning. If \code{NULL}, taken from \code{result$arch_params}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{res.net}}{Updated pipeline result for the specified batch.}
  \item{\code{coinc.res}}{Coincidence analysis result for the specified batch.}
  \item{\code{batch_num}}{The index of the reproduced batch.}
}
}
\description{
Recompute the processing pipeline for a specific batch index or time, including statistics and coincidence analysis.
This is useful when the pipeline stores only the latest `proc` due to memory constraints.
}
\details{
Only one of \code{batch_at} or \code{batch_num} must be provided. The function reconstructs the previous state
of the pipeline up to the selected batch, and re-executes the pipeline and coincidence analysis for that batch.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Reproduce the 3rd batch
out <- reproduce(batch_set = my_batches, batch_num = 3, result = result)

# Or reproduce by time
out <- reproduce(batch_set = my_batches, batch_at = 1126259462.5, result = result)
}
