\title{Two-sided Centered Moving Average Smoother}
\usage{
ma(ts, order, weights = NULL, na.rm = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A `ts` object to be smoothed.}

\item{order}{An integer specifying the window size (moving average order).}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights of length `order`.
If supplied, it will be normalized internally. If `NULL`, a rectangular window is used.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), `NA`s introduced by the filtering at the edges
will be removed via `na.omit()`.}
}
\value{
A smoothed `ts` object with attributes:
\describe{
  \item{\code{collector}}{A character string set to "single" for tracking.}
  \item{\code{q_order}}{The integer order of the moving average used.}
}
}
\description{
Applies a centered moving average filter to a time series, with optional custom weighting.
If no weights are provided, a rectangular window (simple average) is used.
}
