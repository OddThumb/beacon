\title{Split a time series into fixed-length batches}
\usage{
batching(x, t_bch = 1, has.DQ = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ts} object with optional \code{dqmask} attribute.}

\item{t_bch}{A numeric. Desired batch length in seconds (default: 1).}

\item{has.DQ}{Logical (default: \code{TRUE}). Whether to also batch the \code{dqmask} attribute if present.}
}
\value{
A named list of \code{ts} objects, each representing a batch. If \code{has.DQ = TRUE} and \code{dqmask} exists,
        each batch will have its own \code{dqmask} and \code{dq.lev} attributes.
}
\description{
Divides a \code{ts} object into equal-length segments (batches) of duration \code{t_bch} seconds.
If a \code{dqmask} attribute is present and \code{has.DQ = TRUE}, it is also split and attached to each batch.
}
\details{
The function computes the number of batches as \code{round(tl(x) / t_bch)} where \code{tl(x)} is the total duration.
The time series is evenly split based on index, assuming uniform sampling.

If \code{dqmask} is present in the input \code{ts}, it is divided row-wise or element-wise depending on its structure,
and aligned with the corresponding time range of each batch.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
batched <- batching(my_ts, t_bch = 2)
length(batched) # number of batches
attr(batched[[1]], "dqmask") # DQ mask for first batch
}
