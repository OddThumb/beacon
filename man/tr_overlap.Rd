\title{Compute temporal overlap for ARIMA-based filtering}
\usage{
tr_overlap(d, p, q, split = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{An integer or vector. Differencing order(s). Typically 0, 1, or 2.}

\item{p}{An integer or vector. Autoregressive order(s).}

\item{q}{An integer or vector. Moving average order(s).}

\item{split}{Logical (default: \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE}, returns a named vector of head and tail overlap lengths.}
}
\value{
If \code{split = FALSE}, a single numeric value indicating the total overlap length (\code{Mh + Mt}).
        If \code{split = TRUE}, a named numeric vector with components:
        \code{Mh} (head overlap) and \code{Mt} (tail overlap).
}
\description{
Calculates the number of samples to discard at the head and tail of a time series
when applying ARIMA(p, d, q) filtering, in order to avoid boundary artifacts.
}
\details{
The head overlap is given by \code{Mh = max(d) + max(p) + floor(q / 2)},
and the tail overlap is \code{Mt = floor(q / 2)}.
}
\examples{
tr_overlap(d = 1, p = 500, q = 1000)
tr_overlap(d = 1, p = 500, q = 1000, split = TRUE)
